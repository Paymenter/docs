# Configurable Options

Configurable options are a powerfull feature which lets your client customize their product. You can create configurable options for any product.

## How to create a configurable option

In this guide we'll create a configurable option for a Pterodactyl server. The configurable option will allow the client to select the type of server they want to order.

## Step 1: Create the configurable option

First we need to create the configurable option. Go to the admin panel and navigate to `Configurable Options` and click on `Create Configurable Option Group`.

## Step 2: Create the options

Now we need to create the options for the configurable option. Click on `Create new option` and fill in the name.

It is important to set the name to `egg| <Your Display Name>` this is important for pterodactyl to know what variable to use.

For a full list of names checkout the [Pterodactyl guide](/docs/extensions/pterodactyl/#configuring-the-product)

## Step 3: Making inputs

Now we need to create the inputs for the configurable option. Click on `Create new input`.

We want a input for Forge and Paper. So we need to create 2 inputs.

## Step 4: Updating the names and prices

Configurable inputs have a name and a price. The name follows the same rules as the name of the configurable option.

So in my case paper has a id of 1 and forge has a id of 2.
The name of the input should be `<ID> | <Your Display Name>`
